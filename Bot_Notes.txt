Idea No.1 : 
* Destroy enemy's units faster, but keep the base with workers

Idea No.2 : 
* Implement a tactic with regular fighters (light, heavy, ranged - mostly ranged) to keep killing enemy units from afar

Goals: 
* Harvest resources;
* Build a barracks (maybe 2 on the side of the base)
* Train troops (mostly ranged?)
* 


Notes:
* https://github.com/santiontanon/microrts/wiki/Code-Guide
* Game State - Action assignments
* https://pypi.org/project/python-microRTS/		https://github.com/Bam4d/python-microRTS
* Get valid action positions ? 
* Resource management
* Get_action should be a list of actions that unit should do (contains ID, unit_action, type, parameter ??)


Units:
* Worker - 1 hp, 1 damage
* Light - 2hp, 1 damage?
* Heavy - 4hp, 2 damage?
* Ranged - 1hp, 1 damage?
